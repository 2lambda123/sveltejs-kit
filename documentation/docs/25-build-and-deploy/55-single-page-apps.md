You can use [`adapter-static`](adapter-static) to create a fully client-rendered single-page app or SPA.

> In most situations this is not recommended: it harms SEO, tends to slow down perceived performance, and makes your app inaccessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens [more often than you probably think](https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html)).

## Usage

Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js` with the following options:

```js
// @errors: 2307
/// file: svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

export default {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			fallback: '200.html' // may differ from host to host
		})
	}
};
```

The `fallback` page is an HTML page created by SvelteKit from your page template (e.g. `app.html`) that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. For example [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing), a static web host, lets you add a `200.html` file that will handle any requests that don't correspond to static assets or prerendered pages.

On some hosts it may be `index.html` or something else entirely â€” consult your platform's documentation.

## Disabling SSR during dev

During development, SvelteKit will still attempt to server-side render your routes. This means accessing things that are only available in the browser (such as the `window` object) will result in errors, even though this would be valid in the output app. To align the behavior of SvelteKit's dev mode with your SPA, you can add [`export const ssr = false`](page-options#ssr) to your root `+layout`:

```js
/// file: src/routes/+layout.js
export const ssr = false;
```

If you want certain pages to be prerendered, you can re-enable `ssr` alongside `prerender` for just those parts of your app:

```js
/// file: src/routes/my-prerendered-page/+page.js
export const prerender = truel
export const ssr = true;
```

## Apache

To run an SPA on [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), you should add a `static/.htaccess` file to route requests to the fallback page:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
	RewriteRule ^200\.html$ - [L]
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule . /200.html [L]
</IfModule>
```
